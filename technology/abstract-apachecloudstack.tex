Apache CloudStack is an open source that provides a highly scalable and available 
cloud management platform for IT
Enterprises and service providers. CloudStack was originally developed by Cloud.com and was known by the name VMOps. 
In 2011, Citrix acquired the product and donated it to Apache. \\
‘‘CloudStack is being developed to help managed service providers and enterprise IT 
departments create and operate public cloud, private cloud or hybrid clouds
with capabilities equivalent to Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
It uses existing hypervisors such as KVM, VMware ESXi|VMware vcenter and
XenServer/XCP for virtualization. In addition to its own API, CloudStack 
also supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) API[3] and the Open Cloud Computing Interface from the Open Grid Forum.’’

The key feature of the product:
\begin{itemize}
\item        high availability of resources
\item        network management
\item        provides GUI for ease of management
\item        compatible with most of the hypervisors / virtual monitor
\item        it provides the snapshot management. e.g. This feature is 
very useful is saving a state[snapshot] of a vitual machine. 
The vm can later be reverted to the stored state.  
\end{itemize}
 The basic deployment of cloud stack just needs two machines: \\
 A server and a hypervisor that is a monitoring system. 
 The process can be over simplified by configuring one machine 
 to serve both the purpohid-sp18-417-cloudstack.pngse. \\
 The same simple system can easily be scaled to a zone or a pod.
 The below picture explains it well.
