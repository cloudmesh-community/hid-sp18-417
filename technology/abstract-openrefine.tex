by fetching it from different sources. The tool is written in Java. It works with data in tabular format like in relational data.
Once you get used to which commands do what, this is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis
that strikes a good balance between functionality and ease of use /cite{hid-sp18-417-openrefine}.
